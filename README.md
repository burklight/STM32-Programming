# STM32-Programming

In this repo we present some basic coding programming for anyone who is interested in learning how to program a STM32 microcontroller. This work during was performed during the [https://www.upc.edu/content/grau/guiadocent/pdf/cat/230057] SBM course in UPC.

- The guide can be found in the [https://github.com/burklight/STM32-Programming/blob/master/STM32_guide.pdf]{STM32_guide.pdf} file. 
- The code can be found in the [https://github.com/burklight/STM32-Programming/tree/master/STM32/Practica]{Practica} directory.
